# ratchet-components

<a href="https://github.com/twbs/ratchet">Ratchet</a> is awesome, but it's missing React components.

## What's this?

This repo provides ES6 components for React, based on Ratchet's awesome UI.

Ratchet provides native mobile-looking components (headers, sliders, etc.), but they're just vanilla HTML. *ratchet-components* provides the glue between Ratchet and React.
